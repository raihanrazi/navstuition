WP Content Slideshow is the perfect Slideshow for Wordpress. It displays up to 5 Posts or Pages with Tile, Description and Image for every Post.

== Description ==

WP Content Slideshow shows up to 5 Posts or Pages in a very nice and powerful Javascript Slideshow. On the left side of the Slideshow it displays a Image for every Post. On the right side, there are all the Titles (and a small description under the Title) of the Posts/Pages. The Slideshow highlights the active Post and repeats automatically after getting to the 5th Post.
You have a powerful Administration Area to adjust the whole Layout of the Slideshow. Inserting new Posts/Pages now is as easy as can be. Just choose "Feature in WP-Content Slideshow" when editing a post or a page.

As for this update, You have a redesigned slider. With a post slider, post names and a lot more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I insert the Content Slideshow? =

You can Insert the Content Slideshow almost everywhere you want (it looks best under Navigation Bar)!

= Where can I edit the Stylesheet? =

You don't have to edit the Stylesheet you can make changes directly in your Administration Panel (Settings --> WP Content Slideshow)

= What is perfect Resolution for the Images?

You don't have to mind the resolutions. Pictures will be cropped automatically so that they fit the Slideshow!

= Thumbnails are not being generated?

We are not using timthumb anymore - Thumbnails are being automatically generated with Wordpress, when you are uploading an image. If you are already having pictures set you have to regenerate thumbnails using the "regenerate thumbnails plugin", otherwise old thumbnails won't display.
