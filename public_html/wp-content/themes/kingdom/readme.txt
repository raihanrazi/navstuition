== Theme Notes ==

= Slider =

After the theme has been installed the metabox "Slider Settings" will appear in the WordPress admin panel in the post editing section. 
In this metabox you will see two input fields: text-field and checkbox. If you check the checkbox, the featured image of this particular post will appear in the slider.
Every post (or page) has its own metabox, so if you go to another post (or page) and check the checkbox there the featured image of that post (or page) will be added to the slider as well, and the slider will have two slides. You can get as many posts (or pages) to the slider as you want.
The slider itself is located on the frontpage and consists of three parts: title (title of post), image (featured image of post), description (short description typed into the text-field in the metabox "Slider Settings").

= Post Thumbnail Functionality =

By default, Post Thumbnails will appear when posts are being viewed in gallery mode,
in blog mode and also in single posts. Post Thumbnails will not work for pages and posts with post-formats: aside, image, link, status, quote.

= Post Formats: Aside, Image, Link, Status, Quote =

Kingdom WordPress theme only supports these post formats. And stylize them in a certain way. Other post formats will be displayed as normal posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use the Post Formats? =

= How to use the thumbnail and caption? =

= How to locate the theme? =

In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to switch the WP version to the required language and in the configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` write `define('WPLANG', 'de_DE');`. If everything is done properly admin panel will be in German.
If the theme is still not located the following instructions:
1. Make sure that there are the files `de_DE.po` and `de_DE.mo` in the languages folder which is in the root of the theme.
2. If there are no such files you should copy "kingdom.po" from this folder and rename them (you should write "de_DE.po").
3. The files can be edited with the help of the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please download this program, install it, open the file with this program (required language file) and for each line in English write translation in German.
4. If everything is done properly all lines will be in German in the admin panel and in the front-end.
